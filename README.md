## Hi there, I'm Josh (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

I've been writing code since I was small, but for the last 9+ years I've been getting paid to do it in academia.

## ðŸ“š About me

I've been researching various topics in statistical physics for the last 9+ years. My work is equal parts software development and analytics (of the pen-and-paper variety). I'm based in Bristol but I mostly work remotely with my collaborators elsewhere in the UK and in Germany.

You can read more about my research and find a curated list of my github repositories on my personal website:
